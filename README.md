								 Token Machine

************************************************************************************/

The token machine is a school project, where the aim is to make it simpler to get
coffe from the schools machine. The machine today only takes fysical money and
in the todays society, we seldom have it on outselves. 

So we plan to create a token maschine, where you can charge your school card with
money and then use it to get a token, for the coffee machine using an RFID reader. 

Use instructions:
Install GNU ARM Toolchain in eclipse
Open a C/C++ project based on your processor
Create files with CubeMX and generate the code
Use the CubeMXImporter to copy those files into the right place in the workspace
Import the settings to the project, You'll find them in Program_settings folder

The importer and instructions can aso be found here:
